            "* Research hotspots and trends of brain-computer interface technology in stroke: a bibliometric study and visualization analysis *: This study encompasses a total of 693 relevant literature, which were published by 2,556 scholars from 975 institutions across 53 countries/regions and have been collected by 185 journals. In the past decade, BCI technology in stroke research has exhibited an upward trend in both annual publications and citations. China and the United States are high productivity countries, while the University of Tubingen stands out as the most contributing institution. Birbaumer N and Pfurtscheller G are the authors with the highest publication and citation frequency in this field, respectively. Frontiers in Neuroscience has published the most literature, while Journal of Neural Engineering has the highest citation frequency. The research hotspots in this field cover keywords such as stroke, BCI, rehabilitation, motor imagery (MI), motor recovery, electroencephalogram (EEG), neurorehabilitation, neural plasticity, task analysis, functional electrical stimulation (FES), motor impairment, feature extraction, and induced movement therapy, which to a certain extent reflect the development trend and frontier research direction of this field.\n",
            "\n",
            "This study systematically and comprehensively sorted and analyzed relevant literature on the use of BCI in stroke research fields using bibliometrics and visualization technologies. Firstly, this paper statistically analyzes the relevant literature on multiple aspects including total amount, annual publication, citation frequency, research countries, institutions, authors, and journals, in order to achieve a comprehensive description of the research situation in this field. Secondly, based on the scientometrics method, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the research hotspots, topics, and trends of the literature. On this basis, the development prospects and future research directions of BCI technology in stroke treatment are discussed. Finally, visualization techniques are adopted to present the results of literature analysis through forms such as tables and knowledge maps, which improves readability and intuitiveness, and better conveys relevant research information. Through these analyses and presentations, this research aims to unveil the current research status, prominent areas of investigation, and emerging trends of BCI technology in stroke treatment and rehabilitation, in order to furnish unique insights and directional guidance for further research and practice in this field.\n",
            "\n",
            "The relevant literature meeting the inclusion criteria was exported as a plain text file of “full record and cited references” and named “download_xxx.txt.” The exported literature was then imported into VOSviewer 1.6.19 and CiteSpace 6.2.R2 software for the purpose of constructing knowledge maps and conducting statistical analysis. Meanwhile, the literature was also exported in a tab delimited file and uploaded to an online analysis platform of document metrology 1 to generate a national/regional cooperation network knowledge map. The VOSviewer software was utilized with the following parameter settings: association strength was chosen as the normalization method, and the minimum thresholds for country/region, institution, and author were established at 5, 6, and 8 respectively, based on the number of publications. Meanwhile, the minimum threshold of 80, 150, and 50 citations, respectively, was established for authors, journals, and literature. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence for keywords was also taken into account, with a minimum threshold of 20. The CiteSpace software was configured with the following parameter settings: the time span ranging from January 2013 to December 2022, with a time slice of 1 year. Node types were set to include keyword and reference, and the selection criteria were established to identify the top 50 for each slice. Pruning options, including pathfinder, sliced networks pruning, and merged network pruning, were employed, while all other settings were retained as default.\n",
            "\n",
            "The data source of this study was the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded) within the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. To avoid potential bias caused by database updates, the literature search and data extraction were carried out on the same day. To enhance the accuracy of the search, we obtained subject headings from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and constructed the search strategy using a combination of subject terms and free terms. The search formula was set as ((((TS = (“brain-computer interface” OR “brain-computer interfaces” OR “brain-machine interface” OR “brain-machine interfaces”)) AND TS = (stroke OR apoplexy OR “cerebrovascular accident” OR “cerebrovascular accidents” OR “brain vascular accident” OR “brain vascular accidents”)) AND DT = (Article OR Review)) AND LA = (English)) AND DOP = (2013-01-01/2022-12-31). After screening, proceeding papers (8), book chapters (6), and early access (3) were excluded, leaving a final total of 693 relevant publications that met the inclusion criteria.\n",
            "\n",
            "The relevant studies included in this paper have been published in 185 journals. Among them, Frontiers in Neuroscience (59, 8.51%) has the most publications, followed by Frontiers in Human Neuroscience (51, 7.36%) and Journal of Neural Engineering (51, 7.36%). Journal of Neural Engineering has the highest TC, while Neuroimage ranks first in terms of ACPP, H-index, and impact factor (IF), indicating its high-quality and authoritative status in the field. Moreover, all 10 of these journals are classified as Q1 or Q2, signifying a considerable standard of research in the relevant field. The fact that these 10 journals originate from Europe and the United States suggests that they have played a crucial role in advancing scholarship in this domain, as meticulously outlined in Table 5 . Figure 5 illustrates the co-citation relationships among journals. Among them, Journal of Neural Engineering (1,693) has the highest number of citations, followed by Neuroimage (1,605) and Clinical Neurophysiology (1,407). The TLS of these three journals also rank in the top three, with Neuroimage and Stroke being the journals with the highest H-index and IF, respectively. Both of them are Q1 journals, indicating that they are high-quality journals with a high level of academic influence, as shown in Table 6 . Figure 6 depicts the citation relationships among journals, where journals on the right are cited by those on the left ( Li Y. et al., 2023 ; Tang et al., 2023 ; Wang et al., 2023b ). Five main citation paths were identified, indicating that papers published in molecular/biology/genetics, sports/rehabilitation/sport, and psychology/education/social journals are mainly cited by those from molecular/biology/immunology and neurology/sports/ophthalmology journals.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to analysis, a total of 2,556 researchers have conducted relevant studies in the field, and the cooperation network time overlay graph of authors who have published eight or more papers is shown in Figure 4A . Birbaumer N (31, 4.47%) from the University of Tubingen in Germany is the most productive author, followed by Gharabaghi A (27, 3.90%) also from the University of Tubingen in Germany, and Jochumsen M (22, 3.18%) from Aalborg University in Denmark. Birbaumer N is among the top in TC, ACPP, and H-index, while Farina D from Imperial College London in the UK has the highest TLS, as shown in Table 3 . Figure 4B illustrates the co-citation relationships among the authors, wherein the size of each node corresponds to its frequency of being cited. The co-citation relationships and their strengths are indicated by the connections and thickness between nodes, respectively, while different colors denote different clusters ( Chen et al., 2023 ). Pfurtscheller G (706) from Graz University of Technology in Austria has the highest citation frequency, followed by Ang KK (415) from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and Ramos-Murguialday A (337) from the University of Tubingen in Germany. These three authors are also among the top three in TLS ranking, as detailed in Table 4 .\n",
            "\n",
            "Based on statistical data, a total of 975 research institutions collaborated to publish 693 publications, and the collaboration network visualization of institutions with no less than 6 publications is shown in Figure 3 . Notably, The University of Tubingen in Germany demonstrated the most outstanding performance, contributing 68 papers, accounting for 9.81% of the total publications, followed by Aalborg University (35, 5.05%) in Denmark and Fudan University (20, 2.89%) in China. It is worth mentioning that the University of Tubingen also boasted the highest TC and H-index among the institutions, while Aalborg University and Tecnalia in Spain were the institutions with the highest TLS and ACPP, respectively. Please refer to Table 2 for further details.\n",
            "\n",
            "A total of 693 relevant literatures were included in this study, of which 596 were original research articles, accounting for 86%, and 97 were review papers, accounting for 14%. The total citation frequency was 18,367, with an average citation frequency of 26.5 per paper, and an H-index of 64. As shown in Figure 1A , BCI technology in stroke research has generally shown a fluctuating upward trend in terms of annual publications and citation frequency over the past decade. The number of publications increased almost four-fold, from 25 in 2013 to 91 in 2022, while the citation frequency increased almost one hundred-fold, from 39 in 2013 to 3,785 in 2022. These results indicate sustained and widespread scholarly attention to this research field, particularly in the last 3 years when a rapid increase in the citation frequency was observed, reflecting a sustained high level of research interest. Figure 1B illustrates the annual trend in publications for the 10 countries/regions with the highest number of published works. It can be seen that China, the United States, and Germany remain the major research nations in this field. From 2013 to 2017, China had relatively few publications, with an annual average of less than five articles. However, in the past 5 years, China’s publication output has grown rapidly, surpassing Germany in 2018 to become the second highest producing country in terms of annual publications. Since 2020, China has successfully overtaken the United States to become the top producing country in terms of annual publications. This indicates that although China started later in this research field, it has since made significant strides and achieved impressive levels of productivity in the academic realm.\n",

            "As one of the leading research nations, countries such as the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain have a relatively early average publication year for academic publications. During the early stages of research in this field, they made outstanding contributions, laying a solid foundation of knowledge for subsequent studies. In comparison, China, as the top-producing country, had relatively fewer relevant research achievements prior to 2018 and was in its initial stages of development. However, in recent years, due to strong support from national policies and funding, China has embarked on the fast lane of development in this area, producing a large number of academic research achievements, and has leapt to become the top-performing country in terms of both total publications and annual publications. Nevertheless, the ACPP of these research results ranks lowest among the top 10 countries/regions in terms of publication output, indicating the overall low research quality of Chinese publications and a failure to achieve widespread dissemination in this field. Hence, the insight gained is that striving for academic prestige and influence in a research field should not only prioritize the quantity of research achievements, but also pay more attention to their quality. Therefore, in the future development of this field, China should not only guarantee the quantity of research achievements, but also strive to improve the level of scientific research and increase the output of high-quality academic achievements in order to enhance its international influence. Germany has also made outstanding contributions to this field, with the highest TLS, indicating that it has established extensive cooperation relationships with other countries/regions, particularly the United States, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, and Denmark. Switzerland, while ranking only 10th in terms of publication output, has the highest ACPP, indicating a high research level, with academic achievements enjoying widespread recognition and citation from many scholars, thereby demonstrating a high academic influence. A highly cited review study on BCI technology and its applications in severe stroke and spinal cord injury motor rehabilitation, co-authored with other countries, was published by Switzerland (Chaudhary et al., 2016). Furthermore, it is worth noting that 80% of the top 10 countries/regions with the highest publication output are located in North America and Europe, indicating that they are the main strongholds of this research field.\n",

            "The University of Tubingen in Germany has emerged as a leading institution in the field, with a notable abundance of publications. These publications have contributed significantly to early-stage research in the field, with an average time of publication being relatively early. One of their highly cited papers evaluated the efficacy of BCI training in the rehabilitation of chronic stroke, revealing that BCI training can significantly improve upper limb Fugl-Meyer assessment motor scores in 32 individuals suffering from chronic stroke who were randomly assigned to groups. Notably, this improvement in motor scores was found to be correlated with changes in laterality index of functional magnetic resonance imaging and electromyographic activity of the paretic hand, thus indicating the potential of BCI training to induce motor function improvement in chronic stroke patients without residual finger movements (Ramos-Murguialday et al., 2013). Aalborg University in Denmark not only ranks high in terms of publication output but also boasts the highest TLS, indicating its highly frequent collaborations with other institutions, particularly with the New Zealand Coll Chiropract, University of Waterloo, Imperial College London, University of Gottingen, Auckland University of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Among their highly cited works is a study that evaluated the effects and potential mechanisms of BCI training based on Hebbian associative principles in 22 individuals with chronic stroke using a double-blind sham-controlled design. Results revealed that precise coupling between brain commands and afferent signals is essential for the reported behavioral, clinical, and neurophysiological changes, which may become a driving principle for future BCI rehabilitation design (Mrachacz-Kersting et al., 2016). Although Tecnalia in Spain has relatively fewer publications, it ranks first in the ACPP ranking, indicating its high-quality academic achievements that have gained widespread recognition and citations from scholars, thus possessing a high level of academic influence in the field. The institution recently conducted a study examining neural plasticity in the motor network of severely impaired chronic stroke patients following a therapy based on electroencephalogram (EEG)-BCI. The results demonstrated that BCI contributes to the enhancement of the ipsilesional brain activity and proprioceptive function of the affected hand, thereby leading to a reorganization of both contralesional and ipsilesional somatosensory and motor assemblies, as well as afferent and efferent connection-related motor circuits. This reorganization facilitates the partial restoration of the original neurophysiology of the motor system, even in cases of severe chronic stroke (Caria et al., 2020). Despite ranking third in terms of research paper output, Fudan University in China shows a relatively low ACPP, indicating the need for further improvement in its research level. To address this, it is crucial to enhance collaboration and communication with domestic and international research institutions. Additionally, attention should be paid to the fact that Fudan University’s publications have a relatively late average publication year, primarily focusing on recent research areas.\n",

            "Birbaumer N, from the University of Tubingen in Germany, is not only the most prolific author in the field but also one of the top 10 most cited authors. Additionally, his TC, ACPP, and H-index are also among the highest, indicating his significant academic influence and important contributions to the field. One of his highly cited studies conducted a meta-analysis and assessed the effectiveness of BCI in post-stroke motor rehabilitation, revealing that BCI induces functional and structural neural plasticity at a subclinical level (Cervera et al., 2018). Farina D, from Imperial College London in the UK, ranks first in TLS, which indicates close collaboration and communication with other scholars, particularly Jiang N, Dremstrup K, Mrachacz-Kersting N, Niazi IK, and Jochumsen M. Pfurtscheller G, from Graz University of Technology in Austria, has the highest citation frequency of any author and his academic achievements have been widely cited and disseminated. One of his highly cited studies reviewed the current state of BCI technology and the challenges to overcome for its future development (Wolpaw et al., 2002). It is worth noting that high productivity and high citation authors mostly come from North America and Europe, especially Germany and the United States. In contrast, there has not been a prominent research team with significant academic influence in the field among Chinese researchers, and there is room for improvement in scientific research strength and level, which requires continuous efforts to achieve better breakthroughs.\n",

            "Frontiers in Neuroscience is one of the top 10 journals in the field in terms of the number of publications and citation frequency. One of its highly cited articles reported a clinical trial that utilized BCI training on 74 stroke patients suffering from severe upper limb paralysis, which demonstrated that incorporating BCI control into exoskeleton-assisted physical therapy can improve motor function in stroke patients with varying degrees of severity, affected regions, and duration since onset (Frolov et al., 2017). Journal of Neural Engineering is the top-ranked journal in terms of citation frequency and TLS, and is among the top three journals with respect to publications. Furthermore, it has established strong co-citation relationships with other journals such as Neuroimage, Clinical Neurophysiology, Frontiers in Neuroscience, Nature, Lancet, Science, Plos One, IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, Stroke, Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, and Journal of Neuroscience. One of its high-profile papers evaluated the advantages and limitations of EEG-based BCI paradigms from various perspectives and analyzed potential issues of EEG-based BCI systems, proposing possible solutions (Abiri et al., 2019). Furthermore, Neuroimage is the Q1 journal with the highest ACPP and h-index, while Stroke is the high-cited Q1 journal with the highest IF. This indicates that these two journals have high recognition and authority, and their published articles are of great academic reference value. When publishing research in this field, submitting to these highly productive journals can be a priority, and when searching for relevant literature, these highly cited journals’ collected papers can be the first choice.\n",

            "Highly cited literature typically reflects high-quality research and academic impact while also providing insights into the main research focus in a given field (Wu et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021; Li R. et al., 2023). Therefore, analyzing highly cited literature can offer preliminary understanding of the research trends and direction in that field. A highly cited study by Pfurtscheller and Lopes Da Silva (1999) introduced the basic principles of event-related synchronization and desynchronization in EEG and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). The study found that the neural structure of the brain exhibits different responses to event-related potential (ERP) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) or synchronization (ERS), with ERD/ERS being highly specific frequency band. Daly and Wolpaw (2008) conducted a study on the application of BCI for improving motor control in patients after stroke. The technology utilizes EEG brain signals to indicate the current state of brain activity to patients and guides them to modulate abnormal brain activity, thereby facilitating the development of activity-dependent brain plasticity. Pichiorri et al. (2015) conducted a randomized controlled study on 28 patients with severe functional impairment following subacute stroke to evaluate the efficacy of motor imagery (MI) monitored by BCI on post-stroke motor recovery. The results demonstrated that the BCI group achieved better functional recovery outcomes compared to the control group, including a significantly increased probability of clinical-relevant Fugl-Meyer score improvement. This indicates that incorporating BCI technology can assist in MI practice, demonstrating the potential of MI in rehabilitation, and improving the severe motor impairment in subacute stroke patients. Buch et al. (2008) conducted a study on a BCI system based on MEG with 8 chronic stroke patients suffering from hand paralysis. The results indicated that these patients were able to achieve volitional control of the neuro-magnetic activity features recorded from the central region of the scalp after BCI training, and control gripping movements using a mechanical hand orthosis. Ang et al. (2015) investigated the effectiveness of an EEG-based MI BCI system combined with MIT-Manus shoulder-elbow robotic feedback (BCI-Manus) in chronic stroke patients with upper limb hemiparesis. The results demonstrated that the BCI-Manus therapy is effective and safe for the rehabilitation of severe upper limb hemiparesis in post-stroke patients, and the revised brain symmetry index (rBSI) could serve as an important prognostic indicator for BCI-based stroke rehabilitation. The study by Biasiucci et al. (2018) found that the combination of BCI with functional electrical stimulation (FES) is more effective in promoting motor recovery of chronic stroke survivors than sham FES. This recovery is significant, clinically relevant, and durable, and is associated with quantitative features of functional neuroplasticity. Prasad et al. (2010) investigated the role of a BCI system in providing computer game-based neurofeedback during the MI phase of a protocol to 5 chronic stroke hemiparetic patients. The results showed that BCI-supported MI is a feasible intervention that can be combined with physical practice and MI practice of rehabilitation tasks as part of post-stroke rehabilitation programs. Daly et al. (2009) demonstrated the feasibility of combining BCI with FES training for post-stroke motor learning, achieving highly accurate control of brain signals that were reliably used to trigger FES devices for isolated index finger extension. Analyzing burst literature, especially those whose burst has continued until recently, can explore research hotspots and future development trends in the field to some extent. It is noteworthy that six of the papers had burst times extending to and after 2022, indicating that the research findings of these papers may be more closely related to the latest scientific frontiers and have important reference value for understanding the future development trends in the field. Bhagat et al. (2016) demonstrated the feasibility of detecting motor intentions from the brain activity of chronic stroke patients using an asynchronous EEG-based BCI technology. By measuring the movement-related cortical potentials with an optimized EEG electrode placement, motor intentions can be accurately inferred. Successful intention detection can trigger upper-limb exoskeleton movements and guide the movements with real-time sensory feedback, encouraging active participation of the patients. Donati et al. (2016) implemented a multi-stage BCI-based gait neurorehabilitation protocol to train eight chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) paraplegic patients with the aim of restoring their motor function over a period of one year. The results showed that all patients exhibited neurological improvements in various somatosensory domains such as pain localization, fine/rough touch, and proprioception across multiple dermatomes. Utilizing electrocardiogram measurements, patients also regenerated autonomous motor control in crucial muscles below the level of SCI, leading to significant improvements in their walking index. Bouton et al. (2016) successfully restored motor function in a paralyzed human by using intracortically recorded signals to control muscle activation for the first time. Lebedev and Nicolelis (2017) conducted a comprehensive review of the research progress in BCI. The classic objectives of BCI are to reveal and exploit the operating principles and plasticity characteristics of distributed and dynamic brain circuits, and to restore the mobility and sensation of severely disabled patients through the creation of novel therapies. In recent years, BCI research has also introduced new neurorehabilitation strategies, providing new insights for clinical applications. Vansteensel et al. (2016) described a communication method for patients with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, utilizing a fully implanted BCI consisting of dura-subpial electrodes placed on the motor cortex and an emitter placed subcutaneously on the left side of the chest. After 28 weeks of electrode placement, patients were able to accurately and independently control a computer typing program at a rate of approximately two letters per minute by attempting to move the hand contralateral to the implanted electrodes. The analysis of the highly cited and burst literature presented above can aid in acquiring a foundational knowledge of the field, identifying research hotspots, and predicting future developmental trends. These high-quality publications possess significant academic impact and have played a crucial role in driving the progress of the field. Through further examination of these publications, we can gain a better understanding of the current state and future directions of the field, thereby enhancing our research capabilities and the quality of our research outcomes.\n",

            "SCI, stroke, or other neurological conditions that result in loss of sensory and motor function significantly influence patients’ quality of life, often rendering them dependent on home care services for the rest of their lives [96]. Motor recovery is critical for alleviating the psychological and social challenges faced by these patients. BCI technology offers a direct communication pathway between the brain and external devices, which enables the decoding of neural activities and the translation of a patient’s intentions into actual motor control [97]. BCI-based rehabilitation systems provide patients with an innovative and efficient pathway for recovery. In this section, we will discuss the applications of BCIs in rehabilitation, specifically including the control of exoskeletal robots, functional electrical stimulation (FES), and virtual reality (VR) technologies, as illustrated in Table 4 [92, 98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114].\n",

            "For patients with neurological disorders and sensory and motor loss, exoskeleton robots can be programmed to perform specific actions to help patients achieve their goals. BCI-mediated exoskeleton robots can also guide the patient’s paralyzed limbs to perform desired activities through feedback from brain signals, potentially stimulating damaged neural networks and promoting connectivity between different regions [115]. Thus, the BCI-based exoskeleton robotic system allows patients to actively control limb movement according to their intentions, rather than passively following pre-set motions. This approach can significantly enhance patients’ motivation to participate in training and improve rehabilitation outcomes [116].\n",

            "Upper limb rehabilitation robots\n",
            "\n",
            "The application of upper limb rehabilitation robots can be traced back to the 1990s [117]. With the advancement of BCIs, the efficacy and advantages of active upper limb rehabilitation robots are gradually being validated. For instance, Bhagat et al. [118] recruited 10 chronic stroke patients with stable baseline clinical scores to participate in a 12-session BCI-based robotic exoskeleton elbow training program. Each participant performed an average of (132 ± 22) repetitions per session. Post-training clinical assessments indicated significant improvements from baseline in the Fugl-Meyer assessment of the upper extremity and action research arm test scores, which increased by (3.92 ± 3.73) and (5.35 ± 4.62) points, respectively. Additionally, kinematic measurements demonstrated that participants’ movements became faster and more fluid. Next, Cantillo-Negrete et al. [119] recruited 7 subacute patients and 3 chronic stroke patients with severe upper limb impairments, who were randomly assigned to either 1 month of BCI therapy or conventional therapy. After BCI therapy, the scores for Fugl-Meyer assessment of the upper extremity and action research arm test were (23.1 ± 16) and (8.4 ± 10) points, respectively, while the scores after conventional therapy were (21.9 ± 15) and (8.7 ± 11) points, both significantly higher than the baseline scores of (17.5 ± 15) and (4.3 ± 6) points. Following this, Jochumsen et al. [120] recruited 11 healthy volunteers to participate in wrist extension activities using a motor imagery (MI) paradigm. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited through transcranial magnetic stimulation were assessed before, immediately after, and 30 min following BCI training with the exoskeleton. Compared to pre-training measurements, the MEPs increased by (35 ± 60)% immediately after training and by (67 ± 60)% 30 min post-BCI training. Furthermore, Chen et al. [98] demonstrated the efficiency of BCI-mediated exoskeleton robotics by comparing stroke patients using this technology for rehabilitation (experimental group) with those receiving only conventional treatment (control group). The experimental group performed better recovery of upper limb motor function compared to the control group. Subsequently, another study conducted a 4-week BCI-based hand grasping/opening movement training program for stroke patients, indicating that functionally oriented portable BCI training facilitates hand rehabilitation post-stroke [99]. Finally, Lin et al. [100] conducted a randomized clinical trial with 16 young, healthy participants, who were divided into a high-frequency group and a low-frequency group. The high-frequency group underwent MI-BCI training once daily, while the low-frequency group trained every other day. All participants completed a total of 10 sessions of MI-BCI training. The results revealed that the high-frequency group exhibited stronger cortical activation and better BCI performance than the low-frequency group. Furthermore, compared to the low-frequency group, the high-frequency group showed increased cortical activation after 5 sessions of BCI training, with a significant enhancement observed after 10 sessions. In contrast, no similar effects were noted in the low-frequency group.\n",
            "\n",
            "Numerous studies have demonstrated the scientific validity and practicality of BCI-based upper limb rehabilitation. However, designing a comfortable and efficient rehabilitation system remains a significant challenge for researchers. Lakshminarayanan et al. [121] developed a deployable BCI for controlling a virtual iTbot via a tablet. The experiment utilized EEG signals captured with a gel-free cap and processed through multiple stages, including signal validation, training, and testing. A real-time feedback system and virtual gaming environment were introduced during the testing phase, allowing participants to control the virtual iTbot using their EEG signals. This study highlights the potential of MI-based BCIs in robotic rehabilitation, particularly in enhancing engagement and personalization. Additionally, Bi et al. [122] proposed a migration data learning network to achieve cross-subject intention recognition for multi-class upper limb MI. Results from two public datasets showed that this model achieved state-of-the-art experimental performance. Moreover, Zhang et al. [123] constructed a user-friendly and comfortable hybrid BCI paradigm combining MI and high-frequency steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). They integrated a soft robotic glove as feedback to build a comprehensive “peripheral-central-peripheral” hand rehabilitation system.\n",
            "\n",
            "Upper limb robots based on BCIs significantly improve functional recovery in patients. Researchers have also made considerable efforts to optimize AI algorithms and human–computer interaction. These advancements not only enhance rehabilitation outcomes but also lay a solid foundation for the future development of related research and applications.\n",

            "Lower limb rehabilitation robots\n",
            "\n",
            "Lower limb-powered robotic systems, such as exoskeletons and orthotics, have served as devices to assist or rehabilitate patients with walking disorders. These devices are typically controlled by non-natural specific physical actions, such as pressing a button or moving the body [124]. For example, robot-assisted gait training aims to regulate and correct real-time gait in hemiplegic patients by activating muscle coordination and neuroplasticity through repetitive motor coordination training [125]. BCIs enable the interaction between CNS and its external or internal environment by measuring CNS activity and converting it into artificial outputs to replace, restore, augment, supplement, or improve natural CNS outputs [126]. Thus, the usability and clinical relevance of these robotic devices can be further enhanced by BCI technology. To better integrate BCIs with exoskeleton robots, researchers have conducted extensive research. For example, Ferrero et al. [101] conducted a study on MI-based exoskeleton-assisted walking in 7 subjects without motor impairments. They found that EEG signals in the 14 − 19 Hz frequency band provided higher accuracy. Based on this finding, Dong et al. [98] verified that VR technology can enhance the detectability of lower limb movement intentions through a study of 12 healthy subjects. Additionally, Ortiz et al. [102] proposed a BCI system based on MI and user attention, allowing for more precise operation of an exoskeleton robot for lower limb rehabilitation. Ma et al. [92] also designed a composite limb BCI paradigm involving unilateral lower limb stepping actions and contralateral upper limb swinging actions to decode lower limb movement intentions. It was shown that decoding step intent from the composite limb task is feasible and superior to the traditional single lower limb paradigm.\n",
            "\n",
            "The aforementioned studies have developed advanced strategies at both the paradigm and signal levels. Next, we will discuss the latest advancements in EEG signal decoding. Zhang et al. [127] proposed an integrated approach for classifying lower limb MI. This model combines various techniques to enhance classification performance, including multi-head self-attention and temporal convolutional networks. Additionally, a study conducted by Lu et al. [128] investigated continuous control decoding of rehabilitation robots based on a self-learning strategy. Utilizing a multimodal BCI paradigm, they developed an online classification model that decodes EEG signals into control commands, enabling continuous control of lower limb rehabilitation robots. Experimental results indicate that this method effectively reduces computational complexity and model redundancy, achieving an average recognition rate improvement of 17.82% per group. Subsequently, Lin et al. [129] designed a multi-state fusion neural network incorporating both closed- and open-eye states to predict BCI rehabilitation training outcomes for stroke patients after motor recovery. The study demonstrates that the predictive accuracy of the multi-state fusion network reaches 82%, representing a significant improvement over the unimodal model. Moreover, Wei et al. [104] proposed a cross-subject optimal EEG channel selection algorithm based on brain physiological functions. This algorithm selectively retains crucial channels and narrows the computational scope, significantly reducing computational resources. The results showed significant differences in θ and μ band energy of frontal channels between left- and right-side-driven MI tasks, providing new evidence that frontal regions significantly influence lower limb motor MI tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the integration of BCI technology with rehabilitation robots can significantly facilitate the recovery of neural pathways and enhance patients’ autonomy and quality of life. As technology advances, these rehabilitation systems will become increasingly innovative, comfortable, and efficient.\n",

            "BCI-based FES\n",
            "\n",
            "FES can evoke action potentials in the motor nerves of paralyzed muscles and activate the somatosensory cortex involved in the motor neural control loop, allowing functional movement of the paralyzed limb. This process helps to improve mobility in patients with neurological disorders characterized by sensory and motor loss [130]. The BCI-based FES not only promotes rehabilitation through somatosensory feedback by stimulating distal limb muscles but also accurately identifies motor intention to control the FES apparatus, thereby completing the intended stimulation. This approach promotes the restoration of limb motor function and hand-grasping ability [18].\n",
            "\n",
            "In recent years, the BCI-FES-based rehabilitation system has attracted significant interest from researchers. Zulauf-Czaja et al. [105] constructed an arm motor function recovery system that combines EEG and FES to restore hand function in paralyzed patients. In this system, FES is activated when real-time alpha (α) band power decreases below a certain threshold. Similarly, another study used an MI-based BCI system to instruct stroke patients to perform imagery wrist movements [106]. When the BCI detected the imagery of specified hand movements, FES was activated to stimulate muscle contraction, leading to wrist flexion and extension [106]. Furthermore, Biasiucci et al. [107] compared the efficacy of a BCI-FES-based system with FES alone in stroke rehabilitation. The results indicated that the BCI-FES group showed a significant increase in upper limb motor function scores after treatment compared to the control group, showing that BCI-FES is more effective for motor recovery in chronic stroke patients. Conversely, invasive studies have also been conducted. Bockbrader et al. [108] implanted the microelectrode array (MEA) in the left motor cortex of a patient with quadriplegia due to traumatic SCI. The patient’s motor intention was decoded using machine learning. Then, hand animations are generated on a computer-controlled the FES to stimulate the patient’s forearm muscles, enabling upper limb movements such as grasping, pushing, and pulling objects. The authors reported that the MEA-based BCI-FES system significantly improved the patient’s flexibility and coordination in manipulating objects and performing complex movements.\n",
            "\n",
            "Compared to upper limb applications, fewer studies have focused on the use of BCI-FES in lower limbs due to the significant noise encountered during walking and standing. McCrimmon et al. [109] utilized BCI-FES to stimulate the proximal deep peroneal nerve in the paralyzed leg, adjusting the stimulation parameters to achieve a dorsiflexion of approximately 15°. Similarly, Chung et al. [110] employed an EEG-FES system to train ankle dorsiflexion by stimulating the anterior tibialis muscle in chronic hemiplegic stroke patients. Their results showed a positive effect on gait.\n",
            "\n",
            "The healthy brain and neuromuscular system enable individuals to perform activities of daily living naturally [131]. However, for those experiencing functional impairments due to injury or illness, even simple tasks can become exceedingly challenging or even impossible to accomplish. Fortunately, BCI applications based on FES can effectively stimulate muscles and nerves, accelerate rehabilitation, and promote neural reorganization. Thus, these applications not only advance the field of rehabilitation medicine but also offer new hope to many patients, assisting them in returning to everyday life.\n",

            "BCI technology enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices by recording and decoding brain signals. VR technology significantly enhances the human–computer interaction experience by providing an immersive interactive environment [132]. Combining BCIs with VR technology can provide patients with a vivid feedback environment, thereby improving the effectiveness and engagement of rehabilitation training [133]. With the continuous progress of these two technologies, neurological rehabilitation training based on BCI-VR systems is receiving increasing attention. For instance, Wang et al. [111] developed a VR system combined with MI-BCI specifically for upper limb rehabilitation training of stroke patients. The system integrates real-life scenarios into monotonous rehabilitation training, offering 6 training scenarios and 9 training movements. This approach makes the training more engaging and effective through visual, auditory, and tactile multisensory feedback. Similarly, Su et al. [112] proposed an MI-BCI system incorporating a lower limb exoskeleton robot and VR. This system enhances the effectiveness of lower limb rehabilitation training and promotes neurological recovery in brain-injured patients through visual feedback. Furthermore, Aamer et al. [113] developed a real-time rehabilitation system for stroke patients, integrating a VR game controlled by a BCI system. Their study used multiple preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification schemes to achieve high accuracy and real-time response. As a result, the system performed well in terms of patient engagement and providing practical, immediate feedback. Moreover, Xu et al. [114] conducted a real-time control system based on MI using a low-cost BCI to control a robotic arm in VR. The findings highlighted the potential of low-cost BCIs in neurorehabilitation.\n",

            "Neurological disorders such as stroke, atresia syndrome, SCI, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis can cause damage to central motor neurons, resulting in a loss of muscle control ability as well as functional and cognitive deficits. These conditions may also lead to the loss of communication abilities, increasing frustration and depression, further contributing to social disengagement [134]. BCI-based communication applications offer an effective solution to help patients express their will and intentions. Currently, BCIs for daily communication mainly utilize three modalities: spelling systems, handwriting paradigms, and speech decoding (Table 5) [93, 135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156].\n",

However, each paradigm has its limitations, which has prompted the development of hybrid BCI spellers that integrate the advantages of multiple approaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "MI spelling system\n",
            "\n",
            "MI-based BCIs provide a non-muscular communication system for individuals with disabilities, requiring no external stimulation. The first MI-based BCI, named Hex-o-Spell [135], was introduced in 2006. This system simulated the layout of a telephone keyboard to facilitate typing. Its goal was to develop an effective synchronized BCI system that uses a minimum number of controls (2) to select from 30 targets (26 letters + punctuation). Six hexagons are arranged around a circle, with an arrow pointing from the center to one of the hexagons. The 30 characters are evenly distributed within these hexagons, each containing 5 characters and 1 blank space. By imagining the movement of the right hand or foot, users could rotate the arrow or select the hexagon it points to. If an error occurs during the initial selection, the blank side of the hexagon provides an option to return to the first stage. Complete words are then spelled out [158]. This complex paradigm necessitates the development of intelligent user interfaces and natural language processing techniques for spelling prediction. For example, D’Albis et al. [136] conducted an innovative MI spelling system. The graphical user interface consists of 4 rectangles positioned at the edges of the screen. The top, left, and right boxes contain English characters. In contrast, the bottom box provides commands to assist users in controlling the speller, such as undo, delete, toggle between letters and numbers, and exit the interface. Users select the left and right boxes by imagining the movement of their left and right arms, respectively; the top box by imagining both arms moving simultaneously, and the bottom box by imagining leg movements. Furthermore, they incorporated natural language processing techniques to reduce the number of selection steps required. Similarly, Perdikis et al. [159] proposed an adaptive BCI speller based on MI that improves performance by leveraging application-derived context and adapting both the classifier and the spelling process. Furthermore, Cao et al. [137] developed an Oct-o-Spell paradigm combined with an intelligent input method, with an interface similar to Hex-o-Spell [135]. The authors indicate that the predictive text entry paradigm is more efficient than the non- predictive text entry paradigm.\n",

            "P300 spelling system\n",
            "\n",
            "The P300 spelling system features a screen with characters arranged in a matrix format, allowing users to select characters based on event-related potential (ERP) responses. This response manifests as a positive wave in brainwave activity approximately 300 ms after the selection. Farwell and Donchin [160] introduced this P300-based spelling system for character recognition in 1988. In the P300 paradigm, each row and column flashes sequentially to identify the target character. Participants must focus their attention on the desired letter. When the row and column containing the target symbol flash, it elicits a P300 wave in the EEG signal. Although typing speed using this method may be slower compared to that of healthy individuals, it is essential for those who cannot communicate through other means.\n",
            "\n",
            "Over the years, technological advancements have enabled P300 spellers to evolve towards faster, more accurate, and more user-friendly designs. Classic P300 speller paradigms include the row-column paradigm [161], single character paradigm [162], region-based paradigm [163, 164], and chromatic speller [138]. For example, Obeidat et al. [165] introduced a novel P300 spelling method known as the edge paradigm (EP). Unlike existing P300 spelling methods, EP provided an adjacent square at the outer boundary of the matrix for each column or row, thereby reducing the effects of crowding and adjacency by substituting this square for each flash of a row or column. The results indicated that in copy-spelling mode, 14 neurologically typical participants achieved a higher accuracy of (93.3 ± 2.0)% using EP compared to (81.7 ± 2.8)% with the row-column paradigm. Furthermore, EP enhanced communication speed, and subjective evaluations showed that it significantly reduced fatigue while improving comfort. Similarly, Akram et al. [139] developed a P300 typing interface based on the “9-key text” (T9), similar to a mobile phone keyboard. Users enter initial characters through a 3 × 3 matrix interface, and the system suggests candidate words based on the entered characters. The user can then select a suggestion to complete word input. In an experiment involving 10 participants, the traditional spelling system required an average of 3.47 min to enter 10 random words, while the proposed system reduced this time to an average of only 1.67 min under the same conditions, demonstrating an efficiency improvement of 51.87%. Moreover, Korkmaz et al. [140] proposed a novel spelling paradigm that integrates two significant features: three-dimensional animation and the exclusive use of column flickering. Compared to the traditional two-dimensional paradigm based on row and column flickering, this new approach offers enhanced functionality. The experiments evaluated the effectiveness of detecting P300 waves and recognizing target characters using single or multiple combinations of EEG electrodes over 1, 3, and 15 flashes. The results showed that satisfactory performance could be achieved with fewer electrodes. Additionally, all participants rated the proposed paradigm as easier to use than the traditional one. Besides, Medina-Juliá et al. [166] noted that for individuals with severe motor impairments affecting head and eye movement, the size of the spelling device may pose limitations. To assess the usability of three different sizes of spelling interface, the authors recruited 7 patients with ALS and 1 with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The results indicated that the medium-sized speller was significantly more practical in online testing and efficient in workload tests, achieving the highest satisfaction levels among users.\n",

            "Additionally, researchers have focused on enhancing the speed and accuracy of EEG signal decoding. For instance, Xiao et al. [141] proposed multi-window discriminant regularized pattern matching, which won first place in the 2019 world BCI competition. Building on this, Blanco-Díaz et al. [142] utilized filter banks and CCA methods to reduce the number of P300 experiment repetitions, thereby achieving more accurate and faster recognition results. Furthermore, Liu et al. [143] introduced a data alignment method in transfer learning to evenly distribute data from different subjects, effectively reducing inter-subject variability. With advancements in technology and algorithms, P300 speller systems continue to be optimized, providing users with more efficient communication methods.\n",

            "The P300 waveform is a significant discovery in EEG signal analysis with a wide range of applications. However, P300 spelling systems exhibit certain limitations. Firstly, all stimuli need to be executed before each output, resulting in reduced efficiency. Additionally, the amplitude of P300 potential decreases over time, reducing classification accuracy.\n",

            "With advancements in EEG technology, research has demonstrated that when subjects fixate on repetitive stimuli presented at a constant frequency, SSVEP emerges in EEG signals. This has attracted considerable attention, and SSVEP-based spelling systems have seen significant improvements, including larger instruction sets, higher decoding accuracy, and faster response times [165]. Tianjin University has demonstrated exceptional performance in this field, breaking the 100-command set boundary for the first time [167] and further advancing to a 216-command set in 2023 [144]. Moreover, Sun et al. [145] designed a BCI spelling system based on coded visual evoked potentials with 120 targets, achieving a high average information rate of 265.74 bits/min. This system features a large-scale device, high speed, and short training time. In a related effort, Sadeghi et al. [146] developed a speller system that integrates EMG signals with the SSVEP paradigm to enhance the information transfer rate. Mannan et al. [147] proposed a hybrid speller utilizing EEG and eye-tracking technology to improve user comfort in scenarios with numerous flashing stimuli. Additionally, Tang et al.

            "Hybrid spelling systems are developed to exploit the strengths of two or more paradigms [168, 169]. For example, Yin et al. [149] reported a simultaneous hybrid system that identifies target items using two-dimensional coordinates based on P300 and SSVEP, achieving an average information transfer rate of 53.06 bits/min. Expanding on this, Bai et al. [150] proposed a hybrid speller in the frequency-enhanced rows and columns paradigm, which simultaneously elicits both P300 and SSVEP signals. The authors devised different blink frequencies for each row and column to identify the target stimulus once the classifier recognizes the selected columns and rows. This hybrid BCI achieved an average accuracy of 94.29% with an information transfer speed of 28.64 bits/min. In another development, Han et al. [144] from Tianjin University introduced a hybrid BCI-spelling system encoded by a combination of EEG functions: P300, motor-visual evoked potentials, and SSVEP, constructing a layout of over 200 targets. The authors noted that motor-visual evoked potentials and P300 components are significantly expressed in the central, temporal, and occipital regions, while SSVEP features are most distinctive in the occipital region. Online prompted spelling and free spelling results showed that the proposed hybrid BCI speller achieved average accuracies of (85.37 ± 7.49)% and (86.00 ± 5.98)%, respectively, for the classification of 216 targets, with average information transfer speeds of (302.83 ± 39.20) bits/min and (204.47 ± 37.56) bits/min, respectively. In addition to these hybrids triggering paradigms, Luo et al. [151] proposed a hybrid BCI based on a two-stream convolutional neural network (TSCNN), combining the SSVEP and MI paradigms. The TSCNN automatically learns to extract EEG features from both paradigms during training, improving decoding accuracy by 25.4% compared to the MI paradigm and by 2.6% compared to the SSVEP paradigm in the test data. Furthermore, TSCNN demonstrated comparable performance in both single-mode scenarios (70.2% for MI and 93.0% for SSVEP) and mixed-mode scenarios (95.6% for MI-SSVEP mixed-mode), verifying its generality.\n",

            "In recent years, the detection of handwriting trajectories through neural signals has garnered significant attention. This approach not only enhances the user experience but also opens up new avenues for biometric authentication by recognizing the unique neural signature associated with handwriting. Additionally, individuals with severe motor impairments could greatly benefit from this BCI technology, which can significantly improve their communication and interaction capabilities. Notably, Pei et al. [152] recruited 5 participants to repeatedly write “Hello world!” on a tablet while brain signals were recorded using an EEG device. Machine learning methods were then employed to recognize the written symbols. The experimental results indicated that the accuracy of the CNN-based classifier ranged from 76.8 to 97.0% for the same participant, and cross-subject accuracy ranged from 14.7 to 58.7%. These findings suggest the potential for recognizing handwritten content directly from brain signals. Additionally, Willett et al. [93] demonstrated an intracortical BCI that uses a novel RNN approach to decode handwritten actions from neural activity in the motor cortex and translate them into text in real-time. A participant with SCI, whose hands were paralyzed, achieved a typing speed of 90 characters/min with an online accuracy of 94.1%. The authors noted that this speed was comparable to the typing speed of a normal person of the same age using a mobile phone, which is approximately 115 characters/min. The Clinical Translational Research Center for brain-computer regulation at Zhejiang University conducted research on implantable BCIs for a paraplegic patient. This patient is now able to perform complex tasks such as drinking water, eating, and controlling a robotic arm to write Chinese characters through MI. Further improvements to decoding algorithms have also attracted considerable attention. Zhou et al. [153] proposed a temporal channel cascade transformer network to decode the neural activity of imagery handwriting motion, enabling recognition of imagery handwriting based on spiking activity recorded by MEAs. The authors evaluated the performance of their framework using both single-character and sentence-level handwriting imagery datasets from a public BCI dataset. The comparative results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed framework and strategy.\n",

            "Damage or degeneration of speech and other motor pathways, such as brainstem strokes or ALS, may interfere with effective communication without affecting the brain regions responsible for speech or cognition [170]. With recent advances in machine learning and neural recording techniques, BCIs offer a promising avenue to extend beyond cursor control and text generation on computers, enabling real-time speech synthesis. The potential of BCIs for speech synthesis has only recently been recognized, thanks to pioneering studies that utilized intracranial ECoG recordings from patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. These studies indicate that the cortical areas responsible for phonation and articulation are distributed across a large portion of the ventral sensorimotor cortex [154,155,156, 170,171,172]. Using sufficiently dense and comprehensive electrode arrays makes it possible to decode speech and reconstruct its sound from ECoG signals [171]. In a notable study, Angrick et al. [154] used a chronically implanted BCI to synthesize words online, demonstrating that human listeners could correctly recognize 80% of the synthesized words. This shows that individuals with ALS can use a BCI to generate words while retaining their vocal characteristics, providing further evidence of the stability of speech-based BCIs. In another study, Luo et al. [155] performed a 3-month clinical trial on an ALS patient. The researchers implanted ECoG electrodes into the sensorimotor cortex, enabling the patient to operate a computer application via 6 intuitive voice commands. Experimental results exhibited that these voice commands could be accurately detected and decoded without recalibrating or retraining the model. This demonstrates the accuracy and stability of the ECoG implant-based speech BCI system in controlling external devices. Furthermore, Chen et al. [156] developed a novel differentiable speech synthesizer that employs a lightweight CNN to encode speech into interpretable parameters such as pitch, loudness, and resonance peak frequency and resynthesizes the speech using the same synthesizer. By mapping neural signals to these parameters, the researchers constructed an interpretable and data-efficient neural speech decoding system. The system demonstrated high reproducibility among 48 participants, handling data with varying spatial sampling densities and simultaneously processing EEG signals from both left and right brain hemispheres, showcasing its strong potential in speech decoding. Card et al. [172] recently reported a study involving a 45-year-old patient with ALS. The patient underwent surgery to implant 4 MEAs. On the 25th day after surgery, the system was used, the research team collected and processed 30 min of cortical recordings while the participant attempted to speak. At this stage, the neural prosthesis achieved 99.6% accuracy with a vocabulary of 50 words. After 1.4 h of system training on the following day, the neural prosthesis achieved 90.2% accuracy with a vocabulary of 125,000 words. With further training over 8.4 months post-implantation and 248 cumulative hours of use, the neural prosthesis maintained an accuracy of 97.5% during self-paced conversations.\n",

Among these, non-invasive brain-controlled spelling technology is widely used as a primary means of communication. Although handwriting paradigm decoding and speech decoding techniques are typically invasive, they demonstrate significant potential in enhancing communication capabilities. As technology advances, the application domains of BCIs are expanding. In the future, the integration of advanced technologies such as AI and DL will render these communication methods more precise and efficient, thereby further improving the quality of life for patients and helping them reconnect with society.\n",

            "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by abnormal neuronal discharges in the brain [173]. Seizures associated with epilepsy impose significant psychological and physiological burdens on patients and their families, affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide [174]. The most common method for treating epilepsy is pharmacotherapy. However, this approach is ineffective for about one-third of patients [175]. In recent years, BCI technology has made significant progress in epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. This section will explore the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures using BCIs, as well as the application of open-loop and closed-loop neural modulation techniques in managing epilepsy.\n",

            "\n",
            "Epileptic seizure detection systems can automatically identify epileptic seizure events, thereby providing clinicians with critical information for treatment planning. These systems can also issue alerts to reduce the harmful effects of seizures on patients. BCI-based epilepsy seizure detection algorithm mainly involves two processes: epileptic EEG feature extraction and automatic seizure detection. The formal includes parameters such as frequency band power, brain area energy, and global synchronization levels [176, 177]. AI algorithms, including support vector machines [178], random forests [179], CNN [180], graph convolutional network (GCN) [181], or transformer [182], are employed to classify features related to epileptic seizures and determine the patient’s seizure status.\n",
            "\n",
            "Evaluation metrics for epileptic seizure detection systems include sensitivity, false positive rate, detection latency, and computational complexity [183, 184]. Impressively, Burrello et al. [185] proposed Laelaps, an efficient and rapid learning algorithm for detecting seizures from long-term intracranial EEG signals. Laelaps employs symbolic dynamics and brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing to perform end-to-end binary operations. It successfully detected 116 epileptic seizures without false positives in the analysis of 2656 h of intracranial EEG recordings from 18 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, achieving an average sensitivity of 85.5% and an average detection latency of 18.9 s. The Laelaps algorithm consumes between 32 to 35 milli-joules per classification on the Nvidia Tegra X2 embedded device, making it suitable for long-term implantable devices powered by batteries. After years of algorithmic development, Ahmad et al. [186] conducted a hybrid DL approach for detecting seizures in EEG signals. This method comprises two core components. First, it utilizes the K-means synthetic minority oversampling technique to balance the dataset. Second, it integrates a one-dimensional CNN with a bidirectional LSTM using truncated backpropagation through time, effectively extracting spatial and temporal sequence information while reducing computational complexity. The experimental results on the publicly available University of California Irvine seizure recognition dataset show that this algorithm outperforms several baseline DL algorithms and state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Furthermore, Pan et al. [187] combined the EMD of EEG signals with their corresponding PSD, significantly enhancing the decoding performance of neural networks in scenarios with limited sample sizes. Specifically, they used the IMFs obtained from EMD decomposition along with their PSD as inputs for the neural network, while carefully designing the architecture of CNNs. Experimental results indicated that even when the number of training samples was reduced to 10%, this method still achieved satisfactory decoding performance, demonstrating its potential for application in resource-constrained settings.\n",

            "\n",
            "Compared to seizure detection, predicting epileptic seizures may hold greater research value [188]. Studies have shown that identifiable features can be observed in EEG signals prior to an epileptic seizure, such as the appearance of spikes, sharp waves, and high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), which can serve as potential biomarkers [189, 190]. In clinical practice, interictal epileptiform discharges are not always detectable, and EEG recordings may appear normal even in the presence of an underlying epileptic disorder, leading to diagnostic challenges [191]. Therefore, identifying alternative biomarkers would be highly beneficial, as this would enable reliable predictions of epilepsy in individuals, even in the absence of overt epileptic activity. Through continuous exploration and validation by researchers, several candidate EEG biomarkers have been identified.\n",
            "\n",
            "HFOs are transient oscillatory field potentials ranging from 80 to 500 Hz, first recorded over two decades ago in the hippocampus of rats and the human entorhinal cortex. HFOs can be categorized into physiological HFOs (80 − 250 Hz) and fast HFOs (250 − 500 Hz). Physiological HFOs typically occur during sleep [192] and are closely associated with normal cognitive functions such as memory processing [193]. Fast HFOs have been linked to epilepsy, and numerous studies in both animals and humans, primarily utilizing intracranial recordings, have been conducted over the years. These studies aim to better delineate the seizure onset zone and establish the clinical significance of fast HFOs [192,193,194].\n",
            "\n",
            "The second aspect involves changes in brain connectivity states, typically measured through two approaches: functional connectivity and effective connectivity. Functional connectivity refers to the interactions between specific brain regions and is often used as an indicator for identifying potential diseases. Effective connectivity, on the other hand, clarifies how information is transmitted from one specific brain region (referred to as a driver) to another (referred to as a receiver). Coito et al. [195] conducted a comparative analysis of high-density EEG recordings from 20 patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy, 20 patients with right temporal lobe epilepsy, and 20 healthy controls. Their results indicated significant differences in connectivity metrics between patients and healthy subjects. In another study, Carboni et al. [196] examined 49 adult patients with focal epilepsy and 16 healthy controls using high-density EEG and structural MRI. Their findings revealed that even during interictal periods without epileptiform discharges, there were changes in connectivity within the entire brain and specific resting-state networks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, early research efforts primarily focused on extracting features from the pre-ictal phase of a seizure, and an alert was triggered when feature values exceeded the predefined threshold [197]. Additionally, researchers classified EEG recordings into interictal and preictal periods. By analyzing EEG signals during these two phases, they determined whether the patient was in a preictal state, thus providing timely alerts [94]. In 2016, Brinkmann et al. [198] launched an open competition on the Kaggle platform using a crowdsourcing approach to classify continuous multi-day intracranial EEG recordings from humans and canines into pre-ictal or inter-ictal phases (in this study, at least 1 week away from the seizure event). The best-performing algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 0.81. Building on this progress, Gao et al. [199] proposed a self-explanatory DL model for patient-specific seizure prediction: a multiscale prototype partial network. This model measures the similarity between inputs and prototypes as evidence for making final predictions, providing a transparent reasoning process and decision-making basis. The proposed model was evaluated on two public epileptic EEG datasets [Children’s Hospital of Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) and Kaggle], achieving state-of-the-art performance with reliable evidence. Furthermore, Guo et al. [95] developed an innovative epileptic seizure prediction system called contrastive language-image pre-training. This system utilizes contrastive learning, spatiotemporal spectral networks, and dynamic GCNs to effectively extract features from EEG signals and dynamically capture the spatial relationships between electrodes, significantly improving the accuracy and cross-subject generalization capability of epileptic seizure prediction. On the CHB-MIT database, which includes EEG recordings from pediatric patients with refractory seizures collected at Boston Children’s Hospital, contrastive language-image pre-training achieved a sensitivity of 96.7% and a false positive rate of 0.072 per hour. The system’s sensitivity on the Xuanwu Hospital intracranial EEG database was 95%, with a false positive rate of 0.087 per hour.\n",

            "In recent years, with the rapid advancement of modern medicine, approximately 70% of epilepsy patients can achieve a seizure-free life through appropriate diagnosis and treatment. However, 30% of patients still face drug-resistant epilepsy that cannot be controlled by medication [198]. Therefore, research on seizure prediction is of paramount importance, as it has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for epilepsy patients. In the future, continuous advancements in neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and AI are expected to significantly enhance the accuracy and real-time capabilities of seizure prediction. Meanwhile, the development of wearable devices provides new possibilities for the daily monitoring of epilepsy patients, making the application of real-time prediction systems increasingly feasible.\n",

            "Open-loop stimulation\n",
            "\n",
            "Open-loop stimulation is a neuromodulation treatment method primarily used in epilepsy therapy through devices such as vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) or deep brain stimulation (DBS) [200]. These devices activate according to a preset protocol without involving direct feedback between the brain state and the stimulation protocol [201]. For VNS, the stimulator is typically implanted in the patient’s chest or neck via surgery, with electrodes wrapped around the vagus nerve. For DBS, electrodes are implanted in specific areas of the brain, such as the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN), through stereotactic surgery. Depending on the patient’s specific condition, doctors need to program the stimulator, setting specific parameters for stimulation frequencies, intensities, durations, and cycles. In support of this, Grasl et al. [202] demonstrated that VNS implantation is an efficient and safe method for treating drug-resistant epilepsy. Their study showed that 76.7% of patients experienced at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency, 72.1% exhibited improved clinical global impression scores, and 18.6 – 60.5% demonstrated significant improvements in various aspects of quality of life. Further advancing the understanding, Freund et al. [203] hypothesized that the proximity of DBS electrodes to the ATN-mammillothalamic tract (MMT) connection determines the response of drug-resistant epilepsy patients to ATN DBS treatment. The study found that responders (patients with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency) had electrodes closer to the ATN-MMT connection than non-responders. This research supports the hypothesis of directly targeting the ATN-MMT connection, emphasizes the importance of precise targeting and image-based programming in ATN DBS, and provides supportive evidence for future prospective trials using the ATN-MMT connection as a direct surgical target.\n",

            "Closed-loop systems\n",
            "\n",
            "The core principle of a closed-loop system is responsive neural stimulation, which integrates epilepsy seizure detection and prediction algorithms along with stimulation devices. This approach uses real-time monitoring and automatic response mechanisms to control epileptic seizures [204]. Closed-loop systems continuously monitor the brain’s electrical activity through implanted electrodes or external sensors. Upon detecting signs of an impending seizure, the system automatically triggers a preset response, such as electrical stimulation, to prevent or mitigate the episode. Compared to open-loop stimulation, closed-loop systems activate only when seizure indicators are detected, thus reducing unnecessary stimulation and potentially minimizing long-term side effects. In line with this concept, Kassiri et al. [205] introduced a 64-channel closed-loop neural stimulator system-on-a-chip, validated in vivo for both epilepsy monitoring (seizure detection) and treatment (seizure suppression). Further advancing the field, Campos-Rodriguez et al. [206] investigated the inhibitory effect of optogenetic stimulation of the superior colliculus on spontaneous seizures in a genetically absent epilepsy model. The results indicate that single-cell activity in the deep and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus significantly decreases a few seconds before the onset of pulse wave discharges while markedly increasing during and after seizures. Nearly 40% of neurons exhibit inhibitory firing at the onset of pulse wave discharges. Continuous optogenetic stimulation of the deep and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus significantly reduces pulse wave discharges in males but has no effect on females. Conversely, closed-loop neuromodulation is effective for both males and females. Moreover, van Blooijs et al. [207] pioneered the use of single-pulse electrical stimulation to identify potentially effective cortical networks and select a stimulation site connected to the epileptic focus. In the experiment, one subdural strip was implanted above the epileptic focus, while another was positioned at the selected stimulation site. A subcutaneous neurostimulator, capable of recording and closed-loop stimulation, was connected to both strips. Initially, a 3 − 5-month data collection period was conducted to optimize the epilepsy monitoring algorithm. Subsequently, closed-loop electrical stimulation was implemented over the next 7 − 9 months. Clinical trial results indicated that in the 5 subjects with refractory epilepsy arising from the motor cortex, closed-loop electrical stimulation significantly reduced seizure frequency in all participants. In addition to these findings, Kobayashi et al. [204] conducted a retrospective study on 12 patients who received cortical evoked potentials during stereoelectroencephalogram and subsequently underwent responsive neurostimulation therapy. They found that functional connectivity determined by cortical-to-cortical evoked potentials may provide additional information to guide the optimal placement of responsive neurostimulation electrodes. Furthermore, Anderson et al. [208] investigated the impact of closed-loop stimulation during periods of low epileptic activity on improving the therapeutic effect of epilepsy treatment. The study hypothesized that stimulation during low-risk states may help restore healthy brain networks and reduce long-term seizure frequency.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the past few decades, neurostimulation has emerged as a crucial treatment option for patients with refractory epilepsy. Through DBS and vagus nerve stimulation, research has found that large-scale brain networks can be modulated, leading to a reduction of seizure frequency by approximately 50% in about half of the patients. With the continuous advancement of neuroscience and technology, the mechanisms underlying neurostimulation will become increasingly clear. Furthermore, future neurostimulation devices are expected to become more intelligent and miniaturized, capable of automatically adjusting stimulation parameters or triggering neuromodulation responses upon detecting early signs of seizures, thereby more effectively preventing seizure occurrence.\n",

            "Post-cardiac arrest brain injury is one of the significant causes of death for patients who have recovered spontaneous circulation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation following cardiac arrest. It is also the primary reason for long-term functional disabilities among survivors in the acute phase. Cerebral resuscitation, an umbrella term for post-recovered spontaneous circulation brain protection treatments, aims to rapidly implement rescue measures to restore circulatory and respiratory functions, ultimately leading to the recovery of patient consciousness [209]. The primary goal is to achieve adequate brain tissue oxygenation, minimize the degree of brain injury, and promote the return of brain function to a normal state [210]. Currently, standard arousal methods include electrical stimulation therapy, magnetic stimulation therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and mild hypothermia therapy. However, even if a patient’s heartbeat and breathing are restored, their consciousness may not fully recover, and they may fall into a coma or vegetative state. In such cases, communicating with patients, understanding their needs, and assessing their consciousness status pose significant challenges for the medical community. In recent years, the development of BCIs has provided new possibilities for addressing these challenges. BCIs allow for the collection and analysis of patients’ brain signals to detect whether they can follow commands, thereby assessing their consciousness status [211]. Therefore, BCIs exhibit significant application potential in areas such as the arousal of comatose patients and communication with patients in a vegetative state.\n",

After evaluating the patient’s brain function using EEG and ERP, it was determined that the patient exhibited good brain function and a high level of consciousness. Additionally, SSVEP-based BCI typing technology was employed, allowing patients to provide answers on a screen through output or selection without requiring verbal or physical actions; instead, it relies solely on the observation and imagination of corresponding options. This method provides a reliable scientific basis for subsequent diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, Pan et al. [213] proposed an audio-visual hybrid BCI based on auditory P300 and SSVEP. The results demonstrated that 4 healthy subjects, 1 patient in a vegetative state, 1 patient in a minimally conscious state, and 1 patient with LIS successfully completed the intended tasks. Similarly, Qin et al.

            "For patients with aphasia or speech difficulties due to brain injury, BCIs can classify and recognize brain signals by identifying specific patterns of EEG activity. This enables patients to control computer input devices such as spellers and speech synthesizers using their thoughts, thereby facilitating communication with the outside world. Spellers convert patients’ intentions into text output by recognizing their brain signals, while speech synthesizers decode neural activity related to language in the brain to generate voice output [215].

Additionally, research has demonstrated that incorporating the MI paradigm into exoskeleton assistive devices can further enhance rehabilitation outcomes following stroke [217]. BCI technology not only facilitates rehabilitation training but also provides new insights into neural mechanism research. By monitoring and analyzing brain signals in real-time, we can gain a deeper understanding of the functions and mechanisms of the nervous system, thereby providing theoretical support for research on neural function recovery. A previous study has indicated that reorganizing brain functional network topology after BCI training increases coordination between multisensory and motor-related cortices and the extrapyramidal system [218].\n",

Sleep-related disorders have a profound impact on an individual’s health and significantly reduce quality of life. Poor sleep quality can lead to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, mood disorders, and impaired immune system function [220,221,222,223,224].

            "The diagnosis of sleep disorders and the subsequent implementation of closed-loop sleep regulation systems depend on the development of advanced sleep detection techniques. These technologies primarily rely on analyzing polysomnographic recordings throughout the night. Manual scoring considered the gold standard for sleep analysis, is a time-consuming task that can only be performed by trained experts [225]. With the advancement of AI, the speed and accuracy of sleep EEG analysis have been significantly enhanced. Traditional sleep EEG classification methods typically involve two steps: features are extracted from preprocessed EEG signals, and then, sleep stage classifiers are constructed. In these traditional methods, many features are designed based on established sleep knowledge [226]. In recent years, with the rapid development of DL, researchers have shown increasing interest in algorithms that can automatically learn features. DL algorithms enable end-to-end classification and extract the most representative features from large datasets without relying heavily on a priori knowledge, offering specific advantages over traditional algorithms. Consequently, an increasing number of sleep EEG analysis models based on CNNs [227], LSTMs [228], transformers [229], GCN [230], and other architectures have been reported. For example, Yao et al. [229] proposed a vision-transformer-based architecture for processing multichannel sleep map signals. The model captures spatial information from multiple polysomnographic channels using a vision transformer and employs a self-attention mechanism to understand transitions between adjacent periods. Additionally, the authors utilized pre-trained weights from a large image dataset to address the issue of insufficient data. In a related advancement, Kong et al. [226] introduced a novel neural architecture search framework based on a two-layer optimized approximation for EEG-based sleep stage classification (SSC), offering guidance for the automatic design of subsequent sleep classification networks. Furthermore, Eldele et al. [231] conducted an in-depth analysis of 3 SSC datasets. They found that fine-tuning a pre-trained SSC model with only 5% labeled data can achieve performance comparable to fully labeled supervised training. Moreover, self-supervised pre-training improves the robustness of SSC models against data imbalance and domain shift issues. Nonetheless, the sleep EEG analysis domain continues to face numerous challenges, necessitating innovative solutions. Firstly, reducing the computational complexity and energy consumption of models while maintaining high accuracy remains an urgent problem. Secondly, the high individual variability of sleep data and the significant differences in sleep EEG features among individuals place higher demands on the model’s generalization ability. Therefore, future research should focus on developing more efficient and robust sleep EEG analysis models to facilitate the development of sleep disorder diagnosis and regulation techniques.\n",

The primary objective is to modulate sleep through the introduction of auditory, olfactory, visual, and other stimuli. Sleep regulation based on BCIs can be primarily categorized into two forms: open- and closed-loop systems. In traditional stimulus regulation experiments, the stimuli were based on preset parameters independent of brain activity. This conventional method of investigating causal phenomena makes it challenging to accurately elucidate the connection between stimulus outcomes and underlying brain mechanisms. With advancements in computer technology, researchers can now analyze brain activity in real-time and develop closed-loop systems that provide targeted stimulation of specific sleep components based on brain activity. However, both types of systems have their respective advantages and disadvantages and are suited to different research directions.\n",

[233] employed transcranial oscillating direct current stimulation (DCS) at a frequency of 0.75 Hz to investigate whether externally triggered enhancement of slow-wave oscillations during early slow-wave sleep could improve memory performance in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The findings have demonstrated that augmenting the power of slow oscillations during sleep via DCS can mitigate declarative memory deficits in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Similarly, Saebipour et al. [234] applied slow (0.75 Hz) oscillatory transcranial DCS (tDCS) during the second stage of non-rapid eye movement in patients with insomnia, aiming to synchronize the patient’s brainwaves with the frequency of sleep slow waves. Six patients with insomnia participated in this study, and the results showed that the corresponding stimulation intervention had a sleep-stabilizing effect, potentially mimicking the effects of sleep slow-wave-enhancing medication. Additionally, studies of sound stimulation for sleep regulation have also been reported. Bellesi et al. [235] investigated the physiological mechanisms of the K-complex, a peripherally induced slow wave. They demonstrated that acoustic stimulation was the most effective in increasing the amplitude of slow waves across different sensory modalities. Studies have also examined how the intensity, frequency, timing, and mode of acoustic stimulation can influence sleep enhancement. Ngo et al.

This shift is driven by the limitations of open-loop systems in providing a comprehensive understanding of sleep mechanisms [239]. The closed-loop stimulation paradigm establishes a continuous feedback loop between neural circuitry and the external environment. It involves controlling the external environment based on real-time neurophysiological information and providing targeted feedback to the subject, thereby influencing their brain activity [240]. For example, Lustenberger et al. [241] selectively enhanced human sleep spindle waves using non-invasive alternating current stimulation, demonstrating that this targeted modulation significantly improved motor memory consolidation and provided direct evidence for the relationship between spindle activity and cognitive function. Similarly, Santostasi et al. [242] employed a phase-locked loop to deliver acoustic stimuli at specific phases of electrophysiological rhythms, thus enhancing slow-wave sleep through periodic acoustic stimulation. Besides, Ketz et al. [243] aimed to augment slow-wave oscillations using a closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation system. They reported enhanced subjective sleep quality following closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation and improved long-term memory consolidation. Moreover, Ngo et al. [244] reported that delivering exogenous stimuli at the optimal phase of endogenous brain rhythms can improve experimental methods for enhancing memory during sleep.\n",
            "\n",
            "The effectiveness of closed-loop stimulation systems in promoting sleep quality has spurred interest in portable and wearable devices. In this context, Ferster et al. [245] introduced a dynamic sleep-mobile system capable of monitoring sleep biosignals and providing real-time interventions. The authors revealed that their device is suitable for unobtrusive multi-night monitoring and intervention in home settings. Similarly, Lu et al. [246] proposed a closed-loop auditory stimulation system for sleep regulation, leveraging machine learning to track sleep stages and provide rapid feedback via real-time automated sleep staging online. This system offers continuous external auditory stimulation during specific slow-wave phases. Additionally, Bressler et al. [247] designed a wearable EEG device enabling closed-loop real-time tracking and neuromodulation of various sleep-related oscillations. Preliminary results indicate that this approach can offer non-invasive neuromodulation across all sleep stages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Future research should focus on refining algorithms and techniques for closed-loop systems to enhance the precise modulation of specific sleep components, thereby further elevating sleep quality and cognitive function. Concurrently, as portable and wearable technologies continue to advance, these systems could become more accessible and user-friendly, paving the way for personalized sleep regulation solutions.\n",

            "Diagnosis and treatment of AD\n",
            "\n",
            "AD is currently the most common cause of dementia globally, accounting for approximately two-thirds of cases worldwide [248]. The primary symptoms include a decline in cognitive function and changes in behavioral patterns, which can ultimately lead to death in severe cases [249]. According to recent statistics, there are approximately 55 million people worldwide suffering from AD in 2023, with this number doubling every 5 years. By 2050, the number of patients is estimated to reach around 150 million [250]. Current treatment methods for AD include cholinesterase inhibitors, other psychiatric medications, and conservative treatments; however, none of these approaches can completely cure the disease. Recent research has shown that BCIs can effectively assist in diagnosing AD and may help alleviate its progression through specific training methods [251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263].\n",
            "\n",
            "AD typically exhibits no obvious clinical symptoms in its early stages, making this period the optimal time for intervention. BCI technology can detect early changes in brain function, assisting in early diagnosis and timely intervention. For instance, Fukushima et al. [251] applied a character-based BCI to detect AD by asking participants to focus on specific characters. They successfully distinguished AD patients from those with mild cognitive impairment by analyzing the P300 ERP of the participants’ gaze, achieving an accuracy of up to 80%. Similarly, Ung et al. [252] combined fNIRS with BCIs to adjust task difficulty in real-time based on fNIRS signals. The results showed that the healthy control group could perform higher task levels, indicating the potential of fNIRS-BCI as a diagnostic tool for detecting cognitive function in AD patients. Further advancing this approach, Kang et al. [253] optimized the diagnostic method of fNIRS-BCI by proposing a new multi-classification model named CNN-LSTM, which effectively diagnosed early-stage AD patients with an average accuracy of 77.77%, demonstrating the excellent potential of fNIRS-BCI in detecting AD.\n",
            "\n",
            "Treatments for AD based on BCI technology have also garnered significant attention from researchers. These interventions operate through various mechanisms, including enhancing neuroplasticity, regulating neuroinflammation, and improving cerebral blood flow [254]. Among these, exercise intervention is particularly crucial, as research has shown it can significantly enhance cognitive function in patients with AD. These benefits are primarily attributed to increased cerebral blood flow, improved cardiovascular health, and the modulation of vascular factors [255]. Furthermore, exercise can activate signaling pathways such as Wnt and PI3K/Akt, aiding in alleviating autophagy dysfunction and reducing amyloid-beta deposition [256]. Exercise also enhances antioxidant capacity and regulates immune responses, thereby decreasing tau protein and cortisol levels [257]. Integrating BCI technology into exercise rehabilitation provides patients with greater autonomy and a sense of participation, further enhancing rehabilitation outcomes. Galvin-McLaughlin et al. [258] proposed a combination of BCI and neurofeedback (NFB), where subjects were trained using three paradigms: finding the indicated letters, copying spelled words, and crossing out the target letters. It was found that BCI-based NFB intervention for AD is practically feasible but requires further validation due to the limited number of participants. In another study, Lin et al. [259] observed a significant increase in frontal γ coherence through NFB training in AD patients. Moreover, the baseline F4 and pre-frontal γ power levels could serve as predictive factors for training effectiveness, further confirming the potential of combining NFB and BCI for AD rehabilitation. Additionally, White et al. [260] pioneered the use of VR for rehabilitating AD patients by creating a symmetrical, landmark-free house model in VR and training patients to reach designated locations. The 7-week training results showed significant improvements in cognitive function. Although White et al. [260] did not combine VR with BCI, this approach provided a novel method for treating AD. Building on this, Leeb et al. [261] proposed integrating BCI and VR to stimulate the brain through multisensory means for rehabilitating neurodegenerative diseases. Jiang et al. [262] developed a VR-BCI system that assisted clinical treatment of AD by repeatedly stimulating memory. Lin et al. [263] also integrated VR with BCI by using 4 games, Schulte Grid, Eureka Effect, Stroop Test, and Soma Cube, to monitor real-time EEG signals in the α, β, θ, δ, and γ bands for the treatment of AD and cognitive impairment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although BCIs have made significant progress in the diagnosis and treatment of AD, they still face several substantial challenges. One notable issue is that patients with advanced disease progression may be unable to effectively control their brain activity. Therefore, how to incorporate BCIs into the diagnosis and treatment of AD remains an important direction for future research.\n",

            "Diagnosis and treatment of PD\n",
            "\n",
            "PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, with its incidence increasing with age. The disease is chronic and progressive, clinically characterized by 4 primary symptoms: resting tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability. Pathologically, it is marked by degeneration of the dopaminergic system in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain and the presence of characteristic inclusions known as Lewy bodies in the remaining neurons. With the advancement of modern pathological techniques, it has been discovered that the pathological changes in PD are not confined to the substantia nigra pars compacta but involve the extensive nervous system throughout the body. Currently, the diagnosis of PD primarily relies on the patient’s medical history and clinical examination [264]. Diagnosis requires the presence of motor symptoms (such as bradykinesia, tremor, and postural instability) and a positive response to traditional anti-PD medications while excluding secondary causes of PD (such as head injury or exposure to toxic substances). In reality, before the onset of motor symptoms, more than 50% of the substantia nigra neurons have already degenerated [265]. By the time of diagnosis, the disease is often at an advanced pathological stage. If PD could be diagnosed and intervention initiated before the clinical symptoms appear, it would open a new chapter in the treatment of PD.\n",
            "\n",
            "EEG signals contain a wealth of physiological and pathological information, which change correspondingly when neurogenic, pathological, or functional alterations occur within brain tissue. Therefore, in clinical medicine, analyzing EEG signals can provide a basis for diagnosing and treating brain diseases. In EEG recordings from the basal ganglia region, PD is characterized by pathological oscillations in the β frequency band (14 − 30 Hz) [266], with β power being associated with the severity of PD symptoms [267]. Additionally, emerging theories suggest that PD is marked by excessive synchronization in the β frequency band (around 20 Hz) throughout the entire basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit. Swann et al. [268] identified a standard for measuring this synchronization using invasive EEG recordings: phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between β phase and broadband γ amplitude. This standard was also validated using non-invasive EEG, showing that PAC was higher in patients who had paused their medication compared to those on medication and healthy controls. This indicates that EEG PAC could serve as a non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing PD.\n",
            "\n",
            "Implantable BCIs with recording and stimulation functions have revolutionized the prognosis and treatment of PD. Continuous detection of neural signals allows for the developing of more accurate and personalized treatment plans. Therapeutic electrical stimulation induces alternations in brain activity by delivering electrical pulses to targeted brain areas. DBS can be adjusted according to the patient’s symptoms and targets various nodes of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits mediating different disease symptoms. Specifically, DBS in the thalamus is most effective for tremors, DBS in the globus pallidus is most effective for rigidity and dyskinesia, and DBS in the subthalamic nucleus can treat tremor, akinesia, rigidity, and dyskinesia [269]. The improvement in PD symptoms with DBS is significant. Olchik et al. [270] evaluated the quality of life of PD patients before and after DBS surgery and found an improvement in overall quality of life scores post-DBS. In addition to traditional DBS surgery, researchers use DBS electrodes to collect local field potentials and then employ BCIs to assess and provide feedback electrical stimulation, known as adaptive DBS. Adaptive DBS has shown further improvements in patients’ motor scores [271].\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, BCIs play an important role in the rehabilitation of PD patients. Benninger et al. [272] explored the efficacy of anodal tDCS applied to the motor and prefrontal cortex. Their research found that tDCS can improve specific gait parameters in the short term and reduce bradykinesia in both the “on” and “off” states for over 3 months.\n",

            "BCIs in anesthesia\n",
            "\n",
            "General anesthesia is designed to block the patient’s motor responses and inhibit autonomic responses to injurious stimuli [273]. It can also be viewed as a safe and reversible loss of consciousness induced by an anesthesiologist through the administration of anesthetic agents [274]. The emergence of general anesthesia has alleviated patients’ fears associated with imagining surgery without anesthesia. For surgeons, general anesthesia suppresses the patient’s involuntary response to noxious stimuli, ensuring a smooth and controlled surgical procedure.\n",

            "Significance of anesthetic depth monitoring\n",
            "\n",
            "Anesthesia not only effectively alleviates pain and ensures patient comfort during surgical procedures but also induces a state of unconsciousness, thereby reducing fear and anxiety related to the surgery. However, the dosage of anesthetic has significant effects on patients during general anesthesia. Insufficient depth of anesthesia can lead to intraoperative awareness, while excessive depth may result in delayed recovery, postoperative delirium, cognitive problems, and other adverse reactions [273]. Monitoring the depth of anesthesia is crucial as it provides anesthesiologists with an objective and accurate assessment of the patient’s state of consciousness during surgery, assisting them in controlling the anesthetic dosage to prevent intraoperative awareness and minimize postoperative complications [275]. The ideal anesthesia depth monitoring equipment should possess the following functions: 1) accurately measure the patient’s sedation state; 2) be simple and convenient for clinicians to install and use; 3) provide clinically relevant information; and 4) offer sensitive, stable, and interference-resistant data monitoring. Anesthesia depth monitoring based on EEG provides a novel approach to directly reflect whole-brain consciousness changes, providing excellent potential for comprehensive and individualized anesthesia detection.\n",

            "The BCI-based anesthesia depth monitoring\n",
            "\n",
            "The bispectral index (BIS) is widely used to monitor and assess the depth of anesthesia in patients, ensuring safety and patient comfort during surgical procedures [276]. The BIS monitors changes in EEG signals in the prefrontal region and produces a standardized index ranging from 0 to 100. This index reflects brain activity: higher BlS values indicate greater patient consciousness, while lower BIS values indicate deeper levels of unconsciousness [277]. Generally, a BIS value of 80 − 100 indicates wakefulness, 60 − 80 indicates moderate sedation with no response to mild stimuli but responsiveness to severe stimuli, and 40 − 60 indicates unconsciousness. This range is considered optimal for surgery as it ensures that the patient’s brain is not overly affected by excessive anesthetic drugs, nor will the patient wake up due to surgical pain. A BIS value of 20 − 40 indicates deep sedation and 0 − 20 indicates burst suppression, where patients do not respond to external stimuli, but excessive anesthesia depth can impair involuntary functions such as breathing and heartbeat, potentially leading to serious complications like respiratory arrest. During a typical anesthesia process, a patient’s BIS rapidly drops to 40 − 60 upon induction and remains within this range throughout the operation. After surgery, anesthesia administration ceases, allowing the patient’s consciousness to gradually recover, with the BIS value slowly returning to normal.\n",
            "\n",
            "The BIS monitor is the first depth of anesthesia monitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration to assess the effectiveness of clinical anesthesia. As the pioneering and most extensively studied EEG-based anesthesia depth monitor, BIS features a simple and convenient application (requiring only 4 electrodes placed on the frontal lobe), stable performance across multiple anesthetics and their combinations, and has set a benchmark for the development of future EEG monitors. The technical maturity of BIS monitors provides robust support for guiding anesthesia in domestic and international intensive care units [278]. The cerebra state monitor (CSM) is a battery-powered portable device used to detect anesthesia depth. CSM employs a fuzzy logic algorithm to analyze the relationship between parameters derived from collected EEG data and the brain state index, thereby evaluating the patients’ anesthesia depth. Similar to the BIS index, the CSM index ranges from 0 to 100 [279].\n",
            "\n",
            "The Narcotrend EEG monitor is one of the most commonly used and widely recognized anesthesia depth monitoring instruments in China. A significant distinction from other EEG-based anesthesia depth monitors is that it not only provides parameter indicators (Narcotrend indicators) with a range of 0 − 100 for assessing patients’ consciousness but also subdivides this range into 6 grades, labeled A to F [280]. Additionally, the monitor displays a heart rate, 95% spectrum edge frequency, and power spectrum information for various EEG frequency bands (a, β, γ, etc.), providing users with comprehensive data for observation and analysis. Relevant clinical study has shown a high correlation between the Narcotrend monitor and the BIS monitor when using propofol and certain volatile anesthetics [279].\n",
            "\n",
            "SEDLine is one of the few EEG-based anesthesia depth monitors that has undergone extensive updates in recent years. Several studies have indicated that the new algorithm of SEDLine can effectively improve its parameter index and may exhibit notable differences from the BIS index in clinical practice [281, 282]. SEDLine innovatively employs a 5-frontal electrode placed on the frontal region to record 4-channel EEGs. Instead of processing a single hemisphere, it simultaneously processes both hemispheres to generate a density spectral array, allowing for the observation of power spectrum symmetry changes between the left and right hemispheres. Clinical evidence suggests that patient age should be considered when using the EEG state index to avoid administering excessive anesthetic drugs to elderly patients [282].\n",

            "Physiological signals such as EEG and cerebral blood flow can reflect the emotional state of individuals [283]. Consequently, these signals can detect changes in anxiety, stress, interest, and other emotions, with applications in mental health assessment and user experience optimization. Qi et al. [284] investigated the difference in EEG features between patients with high generalized anxiety disorder (HGAD) and patients with low generalized anxiety disorder (LGAD). They found that the phase lag index values for α rhythms significantly increased in HGAD patients, while θ and α1 rhythms were significantly reduced. Additionally, the small-world property was less than 1 in both HGAD and LGAD patients. Furthermore, the θ and α rhythm values in HGAD patients were significantly lower than those in LGAD patients, indicating that the brain’s functional network structure deteriorates as the severity of generalized anxiety disorder increases. In another study, Zhou et al. [285] developed a DL model based on EEG features to simulate internal EEG information and accurately predict human state perception. This has practical significance for alerting subjects to release emotional stress and alleviate anxiety. Interest is an important emotional characteristic. Aminiroshan et al.

            "by Zhuang et al. [28], emphasized the role of invasive BCIs in neurorehabilitation and motor control. While these studies have significantly enhanced our understanding of specific aspects of BCIs, there remains a notable gap in the literature regarding systematic explorations of BCI applications across a broad range of medical fields. Additionally, few studies have addressed the interdisciplinary challenges and future directions necessary for advancing clinical applications.This review aims to provide an extensive overview of recent applications of EEG-based BCIs in the medical field across 8 critical areas, including rehabilitation, daily communication, epilepsy, cerebral resuscitation, sleep, neurodegenerative diseases, anesthesiology, and emotion recognition. Unlike previous reviews that focus on specific technologies or limited applications, this paper integrates insights from both invasive and non-invasive BCIs, emphasizing their clinical relevance and transformative potential in\n",

            "have always been a hot field of interest for researchers. Numerous researchers have dedicated efforts to designing diverse human–computer communication modes. This field has evolved from an initial concept into a practical technology that integrates signal recognition, recording, and analysis [9]. In 1929, Berger [10] first recorded an EEG from the scalp of a boy with a brain tumor, providing early insights into neural activities [11]. Since then, EEG signals have been widely used in clinical settings to diagnose brain disorders. In 1973, Vidal [12] pioneered the use of EEG for human–computer interaction and introduced the term “BCI”. With advancements in neuroscience and engineering, BCIs are now entering a new era of broad applications.Modern BCIs are artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems that process brain activity in real-time to recognize specific central nervous system (CNS) activity patterns. A typical BCI system usually consists of 5 consecutive stages: signal\n",
